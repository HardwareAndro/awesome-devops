# awesome-devops (101)

These websites have significantly shaped my understanding and perspective on the industry:

- https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html
    - and thus `Accelerate` and the `State of DevOps report`
- https://martinfowler.com/delivery.html
    - and thus `Extreme Programming`, `Continuous Integration` and related topics
- https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/
- https://web.devopstopologies.com/
- https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/capabilities
    - covering a broad range of topics such as version control, trunk-based development, CI, deployment automation, testing, delivery, test data management, and shifting left on security. It is very detailed and well put together.
