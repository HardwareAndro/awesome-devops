# awesome-devops (101)

These websites shaped my understanding and thoughts of the industry:

- https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html
    - and thus `Accelerate` and the `State of DevOps report`
- https://martinfowler.com/delivery.html
    - and thus `Extreme Programming`, `Continuous Integration` and related topics
- https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/
- https://web.devopstopologies.com/
- https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/capabilities
    - a broad range of topics around version control, trunk-based development, CI, deployment automation, testing, delivery, test data management, shifting-left on security ...  very detailed and well put together
